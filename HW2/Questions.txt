1. In step 1, which Linux commands did you use to (1) create a new folder and (2) copy
your files into a new folder?


I did mkdir HW2 to create the folder. Then I did cp user.h user.cpp network.h network.cpp social_network.cpp Makefile hw2/.


2. Could any of the breadth-first-search questions (shortestPath and distanceUser) be
solved with depth-first-search? Why or why not?
No you cannot use depth-first search to solve the breadth-first search questions because DFS doesn’t work for shortest path and it can end up returning a longer path than DFS




3. Could the depth-first-search question (groups) be solved with breadth-first-search?
Why or why not?
BFS could solve the DFS questions because BFS can do the same thing as DFS but just quicker and with a shortest path.
4. Can the suggestFriends problem be solved without breadth-first-search and depth-first-
search?
Yes it can be solved without BFS or DFS, I didn’t use either one.


5. Using big-O notation, what is the runtime of your shortestPath implementation in
terms of n (the number of vertices) and/or m (the number of edges)?
O(n+m)


6. Using big-O notation, what is the runtime of your groups implementation in terms of
n (the number of vertices) and/or m (the number of edges)?
O(n+m)


7. In hours, (approximately) how much time did you spend on this assignment? (there
are no wrong answers)
3 hours
